"""
Gap Detection Agent — identifies research gaps, missing experiments, and opportunities.

WHY THIS IS CRITICAL:
This is where ResearchHub-AI adds the most unique value. Any tool can
summarize papers. But *detecting what's MISSING* — that's what researchers
actually need. This agent combines summaries, comparison data, and insights
to find:

1. Repeated limitations nobody is solving
2. Method+dataset combinations nobody has tried
3. Missing benchmarks (no standard way to evaluate)
4. Contradictory findings across papers
5. Novel research directions the field hasn't explored

These gaps directly feed into the Experiment Suggestions (Section 10)
and the Researcher Roadmap (Section 11).
