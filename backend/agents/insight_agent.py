"""
Insight Agent — extracts cross-paper themes, methods, datasets, and patterns.

WHY THIS AGENT EXISTS:
Reading 10 papers individually tells you what each paper does.
But the REAL value is in the cross-cutting patterns:
- What methods keep appearing? (popular approaches)
- What datasets are everyone using? (standard benchmarks)
- What limitations repeat? (systemic problems in the field)
- What themes are emerging? (research frontiers)

This agent finds those patterns that a human reader might miss
when reading papers one at a time.
