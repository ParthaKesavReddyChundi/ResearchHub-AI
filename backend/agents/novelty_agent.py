"""
Novelty Agent — scores research novelty from 0 to 100.

WHY THIS AGENT EXISTS:
Researchers often spend months on an idea only to discover it's already been done.
This agent evaluates novelty across 5 dimensions BEFORE deep investment:

1. Uniqueness: How different is this from existing work?
2. Scientific Novelty: Does it advance theoretical understanding?
3. Practical Novelty: Does it solve a real-world problem in a new way?
4. Redundancy Risk: How much overlap with published work?
5. Opportunity Areas: Where can this be extended?

The score helps researchers decide: "Is this worth pursuing?"
