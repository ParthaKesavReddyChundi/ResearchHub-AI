"""
Roadmap Agent — generates a 30-day researcher learning roadmap.

WHY THIS EXISTS:
New researchers face "where do I even start?" paralysis. This agent
creates a structured 30-day plan broken into 4 weekly phases:
- Week 1: Foundations & literature review
- Week 2: Technical deep dive & reproduce baselines
- Week 3: Experimental work & novel extensions
- Week 4: Write-up & peer feedback

Also provides project ideas, dataset suggestions, and baseline models
so the researcher has everything they need to get started.
