"""
Summarizer Agent — produces structured summaries for each paper.

WHY THIS IS STEP 1 IN THE PIPELINE:
Every other agent depends on summaries. The comparison agent needs them
to compare methodologies. The insight agent needs them to find themes.
The gap agent needs them to detect missing work. Without structured
summaries, nothing downstream can function.

WHAT IT EXTRACTS:
For each paper: Title, Research Problem, Methodology, Dataset,
Evaluation Metrics, Key Results, Limitations.
