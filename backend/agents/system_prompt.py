ResearchHub AGI — Master System Prompt & Agent Identity Constants.

This file is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the orchestrator's identity
and the shared context that all agents reference. Every agent's system
prompt imports from here so that updates propagate everywhere at once.

DO NOT put business logic here — only prompt text and identity strings.
