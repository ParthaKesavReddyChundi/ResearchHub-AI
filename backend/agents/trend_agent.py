"""
Trend Agent — forecasts research directions for the next 1-3 years.

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Choosing a research direction is a multi-year commitment. This agent analyzes:
- Which methods are gaining traction vs. declining
- Emerging tools and frameworks
- Citation pattern trends
- Cross-domain influence

This helps researchers/students pick topics that will be relevant in 2-3 years,
not just today. It also helps identify when a field is getting saturated.
